                          and 12 hrs (undergrad) each semester. In case you are 
                          about to graduate and you would be taking less than 
                          the required hrs then fill the course completion form 
                          from IPO office and submit it before the sem starts.</p>
                        <p class="norm4"><strong>3] When can I start working out 
                          of campus?</strong></p>
                        <p class="norm4"> The law says that every student has 
                          to complete 2 semesters in the new degree with full 
                          time status to be eligible to work outside the campus. 
                          Once you are eligible you have the option to check out 
                          for Curricular practical training and Optional practical

                          any courses?</strong></p>
                        <p class="norm4"> If you withdraw any courses it is fine 
                          unless you fall out of status. If you fall below the 
                          required number of hrs then you have to meet the advisors 
                          in IPO<br>
                          to get the approval and bring yourself back to status.</p>
                        <p class="norm4"><strong>5] When can I apply for OPT?</strong></p>
                        <p class="norm4"> The Optional practical training should 
                          start the day the student graduates (comprehensive exams 
                          or defense). Students in Thesis can also apply for pre 
                          OPT<br>
                          ie OPT before the day they defense and graduate. Please 
                          collect the flyers from<br>
                          IPO office and make an appointment with the advisor.</p>
                        <p class="norm4"><strong>6] When can I apply for CPT?</strong></p>
                        <p class="norm4"> Once you are eligible, ie been in campus 
                          for 2 semesters and maintained F1 status, you can apply 
                          for the CPT. But this CPT has to be clearly part of 
                          your curriculum/graduation and can be of one year maximum. 
                          Please confirm the updates<br>
                          and information with IPO</p>
                        <p class="norm4"><strong>7] Till when can I work in the 
                          campus?</strong></p>
                        <p class="norm4"> The students can work till the graduation 
                          date ie either the comprehensive results day or the 
                          defense date. If the course taken in that particular 
                          semester is included in the POS then the day the students 
                          takes the last exam is the graduation date. You might 
                          want to clarify more with IPO.</p>
                        <p class="norm4"><strong>8] What is my status after graduation?</strong></p>
                        <p class="norm4"> On the day of graduation if the student 
                          does not have OPT then he loses the oppurtunity to apply 
                          for his OPT and loses the student status also.</p>
                        <p class="norm4"><strong>9] What should I do when I travel 
                          outside USA?</strong></p>
